    <p>My research is rooted in the foundational disciplines of mechanical engineering, solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and system dynamics, with a focus on solving problems that demand both physical insight and computational innovation. I view artificial intelligence not as a replacement for traditional engineering analysis, but as a powerful set of tools that when used judiciously can supplement and extend classical methods. Many real-world engineering systems; such as those involved in energy infrastructure, robotics, manufacturing, and environmental sensing operate in conditions that are too complex, uncertain, or data-rich to be addressed by purely analytical or first-principles models alone.
In this context, my vision is to develop hybrid approaches that combine mechanistic models with data-driven techniques, enabling engineers to make better decisions in design, diagnosis, and control. I am particularly interested in using interpretable machine learning to identify patterns in data, enhance reduced-order models, and support real-time monitoring of mechanical systems. My long-term goal is to build tools that are computationally efficient, physically consistent, and transparent; tools that preserve the trust and reliability of classical engineering approaches while benefiting from the adaptability and scalability of AI.
Through interdisciplinary collaboration and a strong foundation in engineering fundamentals, I aim to advance methods that empower mechanical engineers to address increasingly complex challenges without losing sight of the principles that define the discipline. </p>

  <h3>PhD Research Contributions</h3>

  <p>
    During my PhD, I developed a unified machine-learning framework for
    gas-phase species identification from spectroscopic data,
    addressing three fundamental challenges:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Spectral fingerprint learning</h3>
      <p>
        Quantified how accurately machine-learning-based detection methods can identify
        individual gas-phase species directly from measured spectroscopic
        fingerprints, with a focus on terahertz (THz) spectroscopic data.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Mixture component speciation</h3>
      <p>
        Extended these methods to the more challenging and practically relevant
        problem of species identification in gaseous mixtures, where overlapping
        spectral features and nonlinear interactions dominate.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Model limits and interpretability</h3>
      <p>
        Systematically investigated the fundamental limits of ML-based
        spectroscopic identification and developed approaches to interpret model
        decision-making, enabling physically meaningful insight rather than
        black-box predictions.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Key contribution:</strong></p>
  <p>
    My PhD research established the first machine-learning–based detection and
    mixture-speciation methods operating in both the infrared (IR) and
    terahertz (THz) spectral regimes, demonstrating a generalizable pathway
    for data-driven chemical sensing across spectral domains.
