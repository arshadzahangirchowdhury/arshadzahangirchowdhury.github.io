         I have continued to publish in my research areas while expanding my teaching portfolio. In addition to my core courses, I have taught Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (FDL) and Thermal and Fluids Laboratory (TF Lab), which I find especially rewarding for their blend of hands-on experimentation and fundamental fluid and thermal sciences. Through these labs, I guide students in designing, executing, and analyzing experiments that connect theory to practice.

          I began my academic career at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), where I have had the opportunity to teach a range of courses that bridge foundational mechanical engineering and emerging fields of artificial intelligence while continuing my research. My primary teaching responsibility has been Elements of Mechanical Design (EMD), a core course where I emphasize both technical rigor and design practices.
		 In addition, I designed and launched a new course, Machine Learning for Engineering (MLE), which I developed entirely on my own and have now taught multiple times. This course introduces engineering students to data-driven modeling and AI techniques, with an emphasis on practical applications in mechanical and aerospace engineering.

      <div class="ctitle">Research Vision</div>
    <p>My research is rooted in the foundational disciplines of mechanical engineering, solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and system dynamics, with a focus on solving problems that demand both physical insight and computational innovation. I view artificial intelligence not as a replacement for traditional engineering analysis, but as a powerful set of tools that when used judiciously can supplement and extend classical methods. Many real-world engineering systems; such as those involved in energy infrastructure, robotics, manufacturing, and environmental sensing operate in conditions that are too complex, uncertain, or data-rich to be addressed by purely analytical or first-principles models alone.
In this context, my vision is to develop hybrid approaches that combine mechanistic models with data-driven techniques, enabling engineers to make better decisions in design, diagnosis, and control. I am particularly interested in using interpretable machine learning to identify patterns in data, enhance reduced-order models, and support real-time monitoring of mechanical systems. My long-term goal is to build tools that are computationally efficient, physically consistent, and transparent; tools that preserve the trust and reliability of classical engineering approaches while benefiting from the adaptability and scalability of AI.
Through interdisciplinary collaboration and a strong foundation in engineering fundamentals, I aim to advance methods that empower mechanical engineers to address increasingly complex challenges without losing sight of the principles that define the discipline. </p>
